Baby Grand, a mechanical keyboard, designed by me.
This keyboard is a minimalistic 31-key, alpha-staggered, choc only caseless board.

## Get your own
Build with standard SMD keyboard diodes, any CHOC-type low-profile switch, and any pro micro/equivalent. Using whatever custom QMK environment (I recommend QMK MSYS) you use for other keyboards, add `babygrandv2` to your `keyboards` folder, edit the keymap, compile and flash. 

## About the project
I created the circuit board using KiCAD, and wrote the firmware by adapting that of other ATMEGA32-based keyboards. This repository contains Gerber files, and QMK configurations. Note: This is not a 'custom keyboard'  This keyboard existed as a group order, and I sold the last one several years ago. If you would like your own, you will have to order your own circuit boards, diodes, switches, and a Pro Micro-standard controller. You will have to manually flash it using QMK. As this was a learning experience, please do not expect any sort of support for this keyboard in the future. Created during my tenure in the 40% keyboard community.
